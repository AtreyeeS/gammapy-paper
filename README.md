# Gammapy paper

* Repo: https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-paper/ (public)
* Lead: Christoph Deil <Christoph.Deil@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

## Basic info

* To be published in 2017
* Try to keep the paper short and simple (5 or 6 pages?)
* Do add a few code and application examples, but not much about methods or details.
* Journal: A&A (code section, open access and free publication)

## Rules for authorship

* Anyone that has contributed one commit to the Gammapy repository is
  co-author by default and in CC on Gammapy paper communications.
  If someone wants to opt out of co-authorship, they can of course.
* To be discussed: first author will be "Gammapy community"
  with "gammapy@googlegroups.com" as contact email.
  (That's what Sunpy did for their paper, and Astropy put "Astropy collaboration".)
* After "Gammapy community", authors will be sorted by contribution.
  This will be done by Christoph manually, since number of commits or any other
  fully objective metric doesn't measure contributions well.

## Contributions

* All contributions should be made via Github pull requests.
* If you don't have time, a Github issue is also welcome.
* If you don't like Github, email feedback is also welcome.
