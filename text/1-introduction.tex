\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Gamma-ray astronomy is a rather young field of research, 
driven by experiments with proprietary software often based
on ROOT, because of the particle physics background. Such 
as HESS, Veritas or Magic.

The Cherenkov Telescope Array will be operated as an open
observatory for the first time. Thus ther is a need for
open analysis software as well.

In recent years Python has establiched as one of the standard 
programming languages for data science as well as astronomy.
After a phase of many packages the ecosystem was unified 
with \astropy \citep{astropy}.

Gammapy is a Python package for gamma-ray astronomy.

Basic idea: build on Numpy and Astropy, use Python stack

Gammapy is a Python package for high-level gamma-ray data analysis. Using event
lists, exposures and point spread functions as input you can use it to generate
science results such as images, spectra, light curves or source catalogs. So far
it has been used to simulate and analyse H.E.S.S., CTA and \textit{Fermi}-LAT
data, hopefully it will also be applied to e.g. VERITAS, MAGIC or HAWC data in
the future.
